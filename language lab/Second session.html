            <strong>Why does Raskolnikov describe his thoughts as “playthings”?</strong>

            <strong>What does his disgust at the environment reveal about him?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">It shows that he has a sensitive and refined nature, and feels out of place in poor conditions.</p>
          </li>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3️⃣ Apply</h3>

            <strong>How might someone today behave if they felt like Raskolnikov?</strong>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If you were walking in that environment, how would it affect your mood?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">It might make me irritable, anxious, and sensitive to stress due to heat, noise, and crowding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Think of a time you delayed doing something important — why?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">Possible answers: fear of failure, hesitation, not feeling ready, or feeling overwhelmed.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4️⃣ Analyze</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>How does Petersburg’s environment reflect Raskolnikov’s mind?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">The oppressive heat and crowded streets symbolize his internal pressure and confusion.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify contradictions in his behavior.</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">He calls his thoughts trifles but is deeply anxious about them; he thinks yet does nothing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Why does he compare himself to “Jack the Giant-Killer”?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">He’s fantasizing about performing an extraordinary act but knows he’s not heroic.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">5️⃣ Evaluate</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Is Raskolnikov truly cowardly or just overthinking?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">He is not cowardly but paralyzed by doubt and overthinking.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Is the environment entirely responsible for his mental state?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">The environment worsens it, but deeper psychological reasons are more important.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does his awareness of his indecision help or harm him?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">It harms him now by increasing anxiety, but later may aid in reflection.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">6️⃣ Create</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Rewrite the scene from a bystander’s perspective.</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">Example: “He walked quickly through the street, eyes down, muttering to himself. His clothes were worn, and his face looked burdened.”</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Imagine this scene in a modern city — what changes?</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">Crowded subways, car horns, garbage smell, and heat waves instead of streets and scaffolding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a metaphor for his tangled thoughts.</strong>
            <p class="ml-4">“His mind was a maze of mirrors, each reflection leading deeper into confusion.”</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
